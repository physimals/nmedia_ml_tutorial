NMedIA Machine Learning tutorial
--------------------------------

This is a demo to illustrate the general pipeline of machine learning modelling, using
a real-world binary classification problem (breast cancer prediction) as an example. 

Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)

The Breast Cancer dataset (WDBC) is available in machine learning repository maintained
by the University of California, Irvine. The dataset contains 569 samples of malignant
and benign tumor cells. The first two columns in the dataset store the unique ID numbers
of the samples and the corresponding diagnosis (M=malignant, B=benign), respectively.
The columns 3-32 contain 30 real-value features that have been computed from digitized
images of the cell nuclei, which can be used to build a model to predict whether a tumor
is benign or malignant.
